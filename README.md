* This directory contains compressed file of projects made in cororna-sdk, a great tool for mobile developers using lua.

* Stongly recommend this tool which has strong functions of all different cool things, including a lua compiler.

* current projects include: 2 simple 2d games and a news reader. Notice: it's better to run the first game in ios not android otherwise you may encounter some bugs.

* corona sdk has all sorts of elements for making a game on ios or android like a physics engine or scene creator making the job of developing an app extremely easy. Here are some of the documentations in corona-sdk I recommend to read:
